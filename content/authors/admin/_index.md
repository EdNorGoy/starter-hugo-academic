Welcome on my academic page!

I am a PhD student in the MOST team, in the [DRM](https://drm.dauphine.fr/en/drm/home.html) laboratory of [Université Paris-Dauphine](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/)
, under the supervision of [Emer Curtis](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/emer-curtis-01713325) and [Gwenaëlle Nogatchewsky](https://drm.dauphine.fr/en/most/members/detail-cv/profile/gwenaelle-nogatchewsky.html). The (provisional) title of my [thesis](http://www.theses.fr/s234813)
 is *Disidentification and leaving external auditing: a continuous quest*. I also have the honour to take part in teaching at Université Paris-Dauphine.

Recently, I have been in Montréal for three months to work with Bertrand Malsch and Oriane Couchoux. A preprint is coming, more details soon! Starting from January, I am back in Paris.
